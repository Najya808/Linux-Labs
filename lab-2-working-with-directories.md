# Lab 2: Working with Directories

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Understand how to manage directories in a Linux filesystem.
- Learn to create, remove, move, and rename directories using command-line tools.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

In this lab, I practiced basic directory operations using the terminal:

- `mkdir` is used to create a new directory.
- `rmdir` is used to remove an empty directory.
- `rm -r` can remove a directory with contents (be careful!).
- `mv` can rename or move directories.

These are essential skills for navigating and organizing a Linux system.

## ðŸ”§ Commands Used

```bash
mkdir my_new_directory         # Create a directory
rmdir my_new_directory         # Remove an empty directory
rm -r directory_with_content   # Remove directory with files (use carefully)
mv old_directory new_directory # Rename a directory
mv directory target_folder/    # Move a directory into another
