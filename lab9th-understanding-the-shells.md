# Lab 9: Understanding Shells

## Objectives
- Understand the concept and purpose of a shell in Unix-like operating systems.
- Learn how to check the default shell for a user.
- List and identify available shells on a system.
- Practice switching between different shells.

## What I Learned
- Used `echo $SHELL` to find the default shell for the current user.
- Used `cat /etc/shells` to list all shells available on the system.
- Switched between shells using the shell name (e.g., `sh`, `bash`).
- Verified the active shell using `echo $0`.
- Learned that shells like Bash and Zsh offer different features, and choosing the right one depends on the task.
