# Lab 6: Working with Ownership

## Objectives

- Understand file and directory ownership in Linux.  
- Learn how to change file ownership using the `chown` command.  
- Learn how to change group ownership using the `chgrp` command.  
- Explore practical examples of managing file permissions and ownership.  

## What I Learned

In this lab, I learned about file and directory ownership in Linux and how it controls access to resources. I practiced using the `ls -l` command to view ownership details, and used the `chown` command to change the owner of files. I also learned to change group ownership using the `chgrp` command. Managing ownership is important for ensuring security and proper collaboration in multi-user environments. This lab gave me practical experience in controlling who can access and modify files on a Linux system.
