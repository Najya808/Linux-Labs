# Lab 4: Using Text Editors

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Learn to use basic text editors in Linux: `nano` and `vi`.
- Understand how to open, edit, and save files from the terminal.
- Practice navigating modes in `vi` and using shortcut keys in `nano`.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

In this lab, I practiced using `nano` and `vi`â€”two common Linux text editors:

- `nano` is simple and beginner-friendly. I could type directly and use shortcuts like:
  - `Ctrl + O` to save
  - `Ctrl + X` to exit

- `vi` has multiple modes. I needed to:
  - Press `i` to start typing (Insert Mode)
  - Press `Esc` to stop typing
  - Use `:wq` to save and quit

Understanding both editors is important because some servers may only have `vi`, while `nano` is easier for quick edits.

## ðŸ”§ Commands Used

```bash
nano example.txt     # Open or create a file using nano
Ctrl + O             # Save in nano
Ctrl
