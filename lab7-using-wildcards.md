# Lab 7: Using Wildcards

## Objectives

- Understand the concept of wildcards in file management.  
- Learn how to use wildcards to perform various file operations efficiently.  
- Gain hands-on experience with commands like `cp` and `rm` using wildcards.  

## What I Learned

In this lab, I learned how to use wildcard characters like `*` and `?` in the Linux command line to manage files more efficiently. I used the `cp` command with wildcards to copy multiple files at once and practiced using `rm` with pattern matching to selectively delete files. This helped me understand how wildcards can save time and reduce repetitive typing when working with multiple files. It also showed me how flexible and powerful file operations can be when using wildcards.
